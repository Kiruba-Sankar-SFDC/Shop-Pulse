The Supermarket CRM Tool facilitates seamless billing for retail and wholesale customers, utilizing pricebook entries. During the billing process, 
customer mobile numbers are collected for data collection purposes. The system offers a Shop Pulse Point for customers to redeem points and receive discounts on their total bill. 
Existing customers can quickly retrieve their information by entering their mobile number. Post-billing, the system automatically updates product stock, triggering notifications to the business owner when 
quantities fall below a threshold. Additionally, a one-click feature enables grouping of products by suppliers,
prompting email notifications for reorder requests. The tool also aids in employee attendance tracking and simplifies product price modification through automated flows.
